# Semantics and Word Vectors

Word2vec is a two layer neural net that processes text, its input is a text corpus and its output is a set of vectors: feature vectors for words in that corpus. his purpose is to group the vectors of similar words together in vectorspace, to detects similarities mathematically.

- Word2vec creates vectors that are distributed numerical representations of word features

## CBOW method:
giving multiples inputs try to predict one output

## Skip-gram method:
giving one input try to predict multiples outputs
