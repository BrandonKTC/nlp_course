# Topic Modeling

Topic modeling allows for us to efficiently analyze large volumes of text by clustering documents into topics, A large amount of text data is unlabeled meaning we won't be able to apply our previous supervised learning approaches to create machine learning models for the data!

so if we have unlabeled data, then we can attempt to "discover" labels. In the case of text data, this means attempting to discover clusters of documents, grouped together by topic.

## Latent Dirichlet Allocation

According to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, every document contains a small number of topics and every word used corresponds to one of those topics. In reality, each word is assigned a topic according to the law of dirichlet

## Non-negative Matrix Factorization

Non-negative matrix factorization is an unsupervised algorithm that simultaneously performs dimensionality reduction and clustering.
