## Machine Learning

ml is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building, using algorithms that iteratively learn from data. ml allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.

- Supervised learning:

are algorithms trained using labeled examples, such as an input where the desired output is known. The learning algorithm receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs, and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors. It then modifies the model accordingly.
