# Vocabulary & Matching

So far we've seen how a body of text is divided into tokens, and how individual tokens are parsed and tagged with parts of speech, dependencies and lemmas.

- Vocabulary & Matching identify and label specific phrases that match patterns we can define ourselves.
We can think of this as a powerful version of Regular Expression where wwe actually take parts of speech into account for our pattern search.
