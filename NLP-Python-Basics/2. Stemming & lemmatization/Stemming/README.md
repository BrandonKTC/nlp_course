# Stemming

- Porter Stemmer
developed by Martin Porter in 1980. The algorithm employs five phases of word reduction, each with its own set of mapping rules.

- Snowball Stemmer
also developed by Martin Porter. The algorithm used here is more accurately called the "English Stemmer" or "Porter3 Stemmer". it offers a slight improvement over the original Porter stemmer, both in logic and speed.
