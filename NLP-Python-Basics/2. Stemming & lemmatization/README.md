# Stemming & Lemmatization

- Stemming is a somewhat crude method for cataloging related words; it essentially chops off letters from the end until the stem is reached.

- In contrast to stemming, lemmatization looks beyond word reduction, and considers a language's full vocabulary to apply a morphological analysis to words.

- Often when searching text for a certain keyword, it helps if the search returns variations of the word.
For instance searching for "boat" might also return "boats" and "boating". Here, "boat" would be the stem for [boat, boater, boating, boats].
